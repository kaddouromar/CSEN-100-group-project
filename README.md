## Sample User Persona
Dave is a 21 year old student living in Paphos, who loves to spend his time going out and discovering new places. He loves living in Paphos, but struggles to find places to go out and have a good time. He tried using Google Maps to search for upcoming events to no avail. His struggle was solved by this map created by students, where he can now instantly discover highly-rated locations based on his friends’ pins and reviews, and easily join events that his peers are hosting or attending. Now Dave enjoys his time going out with his friends, not having to worry about hustling to find new events or locations.

<br />

## Success Metrics

* User Traction: The amount of people who use the website (measured on a daily basis)
* Number of Events: There should be multiple consecutive events happening every month
* Sponsorships: In order to keep a consistent flow of users, we would sponsor events to gain more users

<br />

## Tech Stack

* Frontend: React framework with all necessary styling and JS files
* Architecture: Amazon AWS (currently still in the works...)

<br />

## Risks & Solutions

* Security: Possible threat actors may attempt to break the website
	* Solution: Sanitisation of all forms of user input

* User Adoption: Real-time social apps may feel slow at first due to lack of community
	* Solution: Through the money saved by using AWS, we could throw more money towards advertising.

* Safety & Privacy: PII data would need to be thoroughly protected
	* Solution: Correct use of GDPR & CCPA Policies
